### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model on Iris Dataset

### Overview
- This repository contains the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model on the famous Iris dataset. The KNN algorithm is a powerful classification technique that predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.



#### Key Features
- Data Exploration: Insights into the structure and characteristics of the Iris dataset.
Model Implementation: Creation and training of the KNN model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Evaluation: Model performance assessment using confusion matrix and classification report.
Visualization: Data points visualized before and after predictions.
